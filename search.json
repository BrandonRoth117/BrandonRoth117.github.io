They went 13-4 finishing with the best record in the NFL while Lamar Jackson took home his second MVP in what was a successful season for the Flock.\nOn the surface, it looks like a well deserved award.

Jackson has been an excellent rusher since he was drafted and 2023 was no different. He led the league in QB rushing yards and the only QB to come close was former Bears QB Justin Fields.\nWhere this gets interesting is rushing touchdowns. Jackson was blown out of the water in this category. Tying at 5 total with QB’s such as Sam Howell and Desmond Ridder, while Josh Allen and Jalen Hurts tied for 15 rushing touchdowns. While one could argue that it’s due to Buffalo’s stellar red zone run game and Philly’s infamous “Tush Push,” at the end of the day, scoring drives are crucial to winning football games.\n\n\nCode\nqbstats |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Touchdowns)) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  gt()|&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    Touchdowns = \"Touchdowns\",\n    Interceptions = \"Interceptions\"\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"The MVP Surely Finished High In Touchdowns...

It’s simple. The Ravens’ defense was an elite unit who finished first in the league in points allowed.\nOnly allowing 280 points in 17 games– a league best. This defense statistically was better in that regard than the NFC Champion San Francisco 49ers, and the AFC and Super Bowl Champion Kansas City Chiefs, who both finished right behind Baltimore in points allowed. Interestingly enough, Detroit, who lost to the 49ers in the NFC Championship, had a significantly worse defense statistically.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=mvpstats, aes(x=PassingYds, y=TD), color= \"grey\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=lamar, \n    aes(x=PassingYds, y=TD), \n     color=\"#241773\", \n    size=2) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 4364.208) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 37.20833, label= \"Average MVP Stats\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=peyton, \n    aes(x=PassingYds, y=TD),\n    color=\"#FB4F14\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=mcnair, \n    aes(x=PassingYds, y=TD),\n    color=\"#4B92DB\")+\n  geom_point(\n    data=lamarfirst, \n    aes(x=PassingYds, y=TD),\n    color=\"#9E7C0C\")+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=qblabels, \n    aes(x=PassingYds, y=TD, label= PlayerSeason)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Passing Yards\", \n    y=\"Passing Touchdowns\", \n    title=\"Jackson Was Underwhelming Compared To His Peers.\", \n    subtitle=\"it was the second lowest passer statistics compared to the other QB's who have won MVP since 2000\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Brandon Roth\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average MVP passing season is around 37 touchdowns and 4300 yards. While examining the other quarterbacks who have won MVP since 2000, Lamar Jackson had the second worst MVP passing season, only passing 2003 Steve McNair, who shared the award with Colts QB Peyton Manning.\nSo… Why did Jackson win this award? Does being the QB of the team with the best record automatically get you the award?\nFormer MVP’s statistically were better than Jackson was. So that argument was taken with a grain of salt, but with situations like this, it’s easy to understand the frustration of fans. If Cooper Kupp, who won the triple crown in 2021 and Tyreek Hill, who nearly broke 2,000 yards in the 2023 season, and 2024 Saquon Barkley who rushed for over 2,000 yards all STILL lose… it’s easy to understand how one can come to that conclusion.\nEven with the 2024 NFL season. The Kansas City Chiefs were 15-2 and Patrick Mahomes was in the MVP conversation despite being middle of the road in most statistics. It seemed like it would be more of the same old noise…\nHowever, last season the status quo changed. Voters couldn’t make Mahomes winning it make sense because he was not near the best QB, while ironically Lamar Jackson boasted some of the best stats in the NFL and Saquon Barkley nearly broke the single season rushing record while leading the Eagles to a 14-3 record– All lost to Buffalo Bills QB Josh Allen, who was one of the league’s best QBs on the second best team in the AFC.\nIt seems times are changing in the NFL as this is the first season since 2020 that the award has gone to somebody who is not on the best team, but in the last 10 seasons (2015-2024) 70% of MVPs have, all were quarterbacks."

There has been a lack of stability since the moment the Browns returned. The miserable seasons led to the flatline: 2017, a shocking 0-16 season, only the second in NFL history (2008 Detroit.) This led to Cleveland Drafting Baker Mayfield first overall from Oklahoma, who would lead them to their best season in 2020, an 11-5 record and their first playoff win since 1995.\nThe Browns have also had the benefit of having the same head coach, Kevin Stefanski, since 2020, before that it was a coaching carousel.\nAfter a disappointing 2021 season (7-10,) the Browns gambled their future on Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson, who since joining Cleveland never recaptured the magic he had in his Houston days,and brought with him an overwhelming amount of off-the-field controversy. Going into year four with the Browns, he has only started 19 games, with a 9-10 record.
